## 1. extraction-knowledge

Extract core knowledge claims from research paper PDFs, classified into 5 epistemological categories.

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Theoretical Foundations | Core theories, conceptual frameworks, hypotheses, models |
| Empirical Precedents | Data, measurements, experimental results from prior studies |
| Methodological Heritage | Research methods, analytical techniques, measurement tools |
| Contextual Knowledge | Geographic, temporal, policy, social context |
| Critical Discourse | Academic debates, limitations, unresolved issues |

```
> "Read Chen2024.pdf and save to Knowledge_isotopes"
> "Process all PDFs in papers folder to Knowledge_environmental"
```

---

## 2. extraction-vocab

Exhaustively extract every content word from a paper, organized by section and POS.

- **POS Tables**: Verb, Noun, Adjective, Adverb — per section with frequency and context
- **Technical Glossary**: Domain, Methodological, Statistical, Chemical, Instrument, Taxonomic terms
- **Multi-word terms**: Kept as units (not split into individual words)
- **Cross-section analysis**: Frequency matrix, section-exclusive words, technical term density

```
> "Extract vocabulary from Weber2021.pdf to Vocab_geochemistry"
> "Extract technical terms from this paper"
```

---

## 3. extraction-logic

Extract three layers of analysis from academic papers:

- **Structure Mapping**: Sections → Subsections → Paragraphs hierarchy
- **Logic Extraction**: Inter-paragraph argument flow + Intra-paragraph sentence logic chains
- **Sentence Frame Extraction**: Exhaustive rhetorical templates (55+ reference frame types, open taxonomy)

```
> "Analyze logic structure of Weber2021.pdf"
> "Extract sentence frames from this paper"
```

Output: Structure tree, logic flow diagrams, sentence frame catalog with `[P#-S#]` traceability.

---

## 4. meta-writing (v0.2.0)

Multi-source academic section writing with clear separation between user's own data and prior research.

**Two-tier source model:**

| Tier | Type | Role in Paper | Citation |
|------|------|---------------|----------|
| My Data | Figures, Tables, CSV | Description & interpretation target | `(Figure 1)`, `(Table 2)` — no author citation |
| Knowledge Sources | Knowledge MD, PDF, Web | Comparison & evidence | `(Author, Year)` with source tags |

**Knowledge Sources priority:**

| Priority | Source | Tag |
|----------|--------|-----|
| 1st | Knowledge folder (markdown) | `(Author, Year)` |
| 2nd | PDF folder (direct reading) | `(Author, Year)*` |
| 3rd | Web search (gap filling) | `(Author, Year)†` |

**5-Loop process:** Source Scan → Knowledge Reading → My Data Analysis + Gap Check → Synthesis & Writing → Verification

**Project config:** `writing.local.md` for per-project paths, figure/table mapping, and writing settings.

```
> "Write Results section based on my figures and Knowledge folder"
> "이 그림 기반으로 Discussion 써줘"
> "Write Introduction from Knowledge_environmental"
```

Output: English + Korean dual output, APA 7 references (source-tagged), 4-step verification report.

---

## 5. meta-rewriting

One-shot style transfer pipeline: reverse-engineer writing style from a reference paper, generate a Style Blueprint, then apply it to the user's draft in a single session.

- **Style Blueprint**: 6-dimension analysis (Tone, Sentence Architecture, Logical Flow, Transitions, Vocabulary, Citation Style)
- **Gap Analysis**: Score each dimension 1-10, identify weaknesses
- **Two modes**: [A] Sentence-level feedback / [B] Full rewrite

```
> "이 논문처럼 써줘"
> "Nature Geoscience 스타일로 맞춰줘"
> "Rewrite my draft in the style of this paper"
```

Output: `Rewrite_{topic}/` folder with blueprint, gap analysis, and rewritten draft.

---

## 6. meta-styling

Two-mode skill for analyzing and applying academic writing styles.

- **Mode A (Extraction)**: Extract sentence patterns, vocabulary, transitions, hedging, quantitative expressions, and citation patterns per IMRaD section → Save to `Style_{topic}/`
- **Mode B (Revision)**: Compare user draft against extracted data bank → Revise to match target style

```
> "Extract style from Weber2021.pdf to Style_geochemistry"
> "Revise my Introduction to match Style_geochemistry"
```

---

## 7. meta-review

Multi-reviewer draft improvement using pre-extracted logic and vocabulary analysis files.

- **Per-paper Reviewers**: One subagent per reference paper, running in parallel
- **Four Academic Principles**: Argument Architecture, Prose Rhythm, Cohesion & Coherence, Academic Register
- **Three Intensity Levels**: Light (flag only) / Standard (flag + rewrites) / Deep (full rewrite)
- **Three Severity Levels**: Critical / Major / Minor

```
> "Review this Introduction paragraph"
> "Deep rewrite this Methods section using all reference papers"
> "Check logic flow only. Light mode."
```

Output: `Review_{timestamp}/` folder with individual reviewer reports, cross-reviewer synthesis, and improved draft with change log.

---

## 8. agentic-research

Kosmos-inspired autonomous research framework for iterative data-driven scientific discovery.

- **Multi-cycle analysis**: Hypothesis generation → code execution → literature grounding → refinement
- **World Model**: Maintains evolving JSON state of discoveries, hypotheses, and evidence
- **Literature integration**: Combines data analysis with web search for scientific context
- **Python scripts**: Dataset profiling, world model management, report generation

```
> "Analyze this dataset and find interesting patterns"
> "Run agentic research on my environmental data"
> "Iterative hypothesis testing on this CSV"
```

Output: `Research_{topic}/` folder with world model, analysis notebooks, and structured report.

---

## Typical Workflows

### Full paper analysis
```
1. extraction-knowledge  → extract cited knowledge
2. extraction-vocab      → build word inventory + technical glossary
3. extraction-logic      → map argument structure + sentence frames
4. meta-styling (Mode A) → extract stylistic patterns
```

### Academic writing
```
1. meta-writing          → draft sections using My Data + Knowledge + PDF + Web
2. meta-review           → multi-reviewer improvement using logic+vocab extractions
3. meta-styling (Mode B) → revise draft to match target journal style
4. meta-rewriting        → one-shot style transfer from reference paper
```

### Autonomous research
```
1. agentic-research      → iterative data analysis + literature grounding
2. meta-writing          → write up findings with proper citations
3. meta-review           → review and improve the manuscript
```
